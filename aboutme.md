Hello! I am an Android Developer at [Detroit Labs](https://www.detroitlabs.com/). I love writing clean, crisp code and impacting large numbers of users with my work.

I was previously a mathematician and data scientist, and earned a Ph.D. in Applied Math from the [University of Arizona](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/).
